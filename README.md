## Folder Structure
1. The folder structure I use: 

   ```bash
    ML-Practice/
    │
    ├─ Data Cleaning/ # Scripts and notebooks for cleaning and preprocessing datasets
    ├─ Dataset/ # Raw and processed datasets used in ML experiments
    ├─ Feature Selection Techniques/ # Techniques to select important features for modeling
    ├─ Figures/ # Visualizations and plots generated during analysis
    ├─ Supervised Learning/ # Implementation of supervised ML algorithms
    ├─ README.md # Project documentation
    └─ requirements.txt # Python dependencies for running the notebooks/scripts

## Features & Contents

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.  
- **Dataset:** Includes multiple datasets for practice and experimentation.  
- **Feature Selection Techniques:** Methods like correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and tree-based selection.  
- **Figures:** Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and feature importance charts.  
- **Supervised Learning:** Implementation of algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and KNN.
